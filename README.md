# Odin Recipes

## About

**Odin Recipes** is a barebones recipe website for personal HTML and git
  practice. I did not create any of the recipes - they are all borrowed from [Hello
  Fresh](https://www.hellofresh.com).

Source links are provided. Built while following [The Odin
Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com) HTML foundations course.
