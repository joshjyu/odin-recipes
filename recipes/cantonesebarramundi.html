    <p><strong>Steamed Cantonese-Style Barramundi</strong> is a spin on classic
      Cantonese-style steamed fish. Traditionally, this dish could be found in a
      Chinese wedding banquet, but also at home for a typical meal. There is a
      variety of fish that can be steamed - pretty much any delicate white fish
      works.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Jasmine Rice
      <li>Green Beans
      <li>Ginger
      <li>Scallions
      <li>Cilantro
      <li>Soy Sauce
      <li>Ponzu Sauce
      <li>Barramundi
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 425. Wash and dry produce.
      <li>Cook jasmine rice (for ease, use a rice cooker).
      <li>Trim green beans. Peel and julienne the ginger.
      <li>Trim and halve the scallions lengthwise; cut crosswise into 1-inch pieces. Separate the whites from the greens.
      <li>Roughly chop cilantro.
      <li>In a medium bowl, whisk soy sauce, ponzu, 2 tbsp warm water, and 1 tsp sugar until the sugar dissolves.
      <li>Toss green beans on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Roast for 12-15 minutes until browned and tender.
      <li>Season barramundi with salt and pepper. Steam the barramundi skin side down until it is cooked through and easily flakes, 8-10 minutes.
      <li>While fish steams, heat 1 tbsp oil in a small pan over medium-high heat. Add ginger and scallion whites. Stir until fragrant and scallion whites are lightly browned, 2-3 minutes.
      <li>Stir in scallion greens and half the cilantro. Add soy sauce mixture and stir until sauce has reduced slightly, 30-60 seconds.
      <li>Plate the rice, green beans, and fish, and spoon sauce over barramundi. Garnish with cilantro.
