      <p><strong>Dan dan noodles</strong> is a dish originating from Szechuan
	cuisine. Its ingredients traditionally include spicy sauce, vegetables,
	mustard stems, Szechuan pepper, pork, scallions, chili oil, and
	noodles. Western styles of dan dan noodles sometimes substitute the spicy
	sauce with peanut butter or sesame paste.</p>
